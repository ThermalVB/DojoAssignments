      <p><h1>JavaScript Basics</h1></p>
      <p>
        JaveScript is a cross platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is
        extremely popular for a vaiety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language
        allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different
        directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server),
        it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic
        control over them.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="url">Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for
          storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee,
          a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique
          names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span style="color:#768ADC">var x;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="url">Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript
          variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold.
          The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span style="color:#768ADC">var x = 10;</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="url">Data types</a> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on
          variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript
          primitives: Boolean - <span style="color:#768ADC">true</span> or <span style="color:#768ADC">false;</span>
          null - <span style="color:#768ADC">null</span> aka nothing; Number - <span style="color:#768ADC">42</span>
           or <span style="color:#768ADC">>3.14159;</span> String - <span style="color:#768ADC">"Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span>
            Array - <span style="color:#768ADC">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</span> and Object - <span style="color:#768ADC">{first_name: 'Jane,Last_name: 'Doe'}</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="url">Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions
          - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements
          in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional
          statements: <span style="color:#768ADC">if</span> a specified condition
          is true, do this code in our block; <span style="color:#768ADC">else if</span>
          to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
           <span style="color:#768ADC">else</span> we execute this block of code;
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="url">Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every
          programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they
          will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a
          mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="url">Function</a> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block.
          When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it
          as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together
          a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started,
          first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the
          right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton
          more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.
